    "SD" for his friends, or "idiot".
    Dark elf with an innate flair for magic. Chaotic, braggart, pyromaniac and stubborn, but he also has some flaws....
    Suo padre era un avventuriero della prima edizione che gli ha lasciato in eredita' un artefatto che pero' lui non ha mai osato toccare.
    His father was an adventurer from the first-edition who bequeathed him an artifact that he never dared to touch, though.

    Big, ugly, mean, violent and smelly.
    Despite everything he considers the rest of the group to be his family, but it's still a good idea to never contradict him.

    A slimy treacherous liar with little inclination for dialogue and compassion.
    He has never shared anything about his past; he probably has some unfinished business with somebody.

    The last member to join the group, he has yet to understand how the game world turns.
    Nonetheless, his unpredictability and thinking out of the box often helps him cope remarkably well.
